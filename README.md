Thaliak is a Final Fantasy XIV patch tracking service.

A public version of the service is hosted at [thaliak.xiv.dev](https://thaliak.xiv.dev).
Most people will likely want to use the public version, but you can also use the code in this repository to self-host your own instance.

## Features
### Current
- Tracks game versions for FFXIV Global, Korea, and China
  - FFXIV Global uses a service account to log in and retrieve the patch list; all other regions do not require login to obtain the patch list
  - FFXIV Global will also scrape maintenance times from the Lodestone, and use that to determine when to poll more frequently for a new patch. 
- Provides an [API](https://thaliak.xiv.dev/api) that can be consumed to retrieve patch information
- Provides a rudimentary [web interface](https://thaliak.xiv.dev) that displays patch information and API usage examples.
  - [The web interface has its own GitHub repository, available here.](https://github.com/avafloww/thaliak-web)
- Provides Discord webhook alerts. If you would like alerts set up in your own server, please contact me (Avaflow). ![](assets/screenshot-discord.png)

### Planned
- Automatic summary of operations in ZiPatch files
- Automated disassembly of new game versions, including:
  - Checks for crucial signatures in [FFXIVClientStructs](https://github.com/aers/FFXIVClientStructs)
  - Executable strings tracking
  - ...and more?
- Automatic generation of patch index files for XIVLauncher
- Automatic creation of torrent files for patch downloads


## Funding
There are some small recurring costs to maintaining the public Thaliak instance, including:
- A separate game subscription for FFXIV Global
- Server costs
- Storage costs

[Any assistance in covering these costs is appreciated, but not required.](https://github.com/sponsors/avafloww)
